        <h1>What is Mandala Art?<a name="defination"></a></h1>
        <div class="deftext">
          Mandala is a Sanskrit word that means "circle," and it represents
          the universe in Hindu and Buddhist symbolism. Mandala art is a form of geometric art that uses circles, squares, triangles, and other shapes
          to create intricate patterns and designs. Mandalas can be simple or complex, depending on the
          level of detail and the number of shapes used. They can also be created using different media, such as paper, canvas, wood, or even sand.
          In recent years, mandalas have become popular as a form
          of art therapy, helping people to relax, reduce stress, and find inner peace. In this webpage,
          we will explore the beauty and benefits of mandala art and learn how to create your own mandalas.  </div>

        <h1>HISTORY<a name="history"></a></h1>
        <p>Mandala art has been created for thousands of years in various cultures around the world. The word "mandala" comes from the Sanskrit language and means "circle" or "center." In Hinduism and Buddhism, mandalas are used as a tool for meditation and spiritual growth. They are often created in sand or paint, and the process of creating them is considered a form of meditation.</p>

        <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, mandalas are used in elaborate rituals, with monks spending weeks or months creating intricate sand mandalas that are then destroyed to represent the impermanence of all things. In Native American cultures, mandalas are used in healing rituals to connect with the spiritual world.</p>

        <p>Today, mandala art has become popular as a form of therapy and relaxation technique, helping people to reduce stress and find inner peace. It has also been adopted by the Western art world, with contemporary artists creating mandalas in a variety of media, including sculpture, painting, and digital art.</p>
